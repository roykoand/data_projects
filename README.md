## â™Ÿ My chess games analysis (```spark/```)
I've used the Lichess API to download all my chess games. Then with ```pyspark```, I created a little games statistics and moves analysis. Jupyter-notebook with analysis also contains gif and png images of the chessboard made by ```pgn2gif``` and ```python-chess```.

## ðŸ’¨ Airflow (```airflow/```)
In this directory, I worked with Airflow DAGs and made a toy DAG for creating a graph with bitcoin rate per particular time.
