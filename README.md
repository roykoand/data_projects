# Just for fun

## â™Ÿ My chess games analysis (```chess_data/```) 
I used the Lichess API to download all my chess games on the Lichess. Then with ```pyspark```, I created little lichess games statistics and moves analysis. Jupyter-notebook with analysis also contains gif and png images of the chessboard, made with ```pgn2gif``` and ```python-chess```, respectively. ```chess_data/``` directory contains ```requirements.txt``` with all necessary libraries for ```notebook.ipynb```.
